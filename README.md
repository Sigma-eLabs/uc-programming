[Microcontroller Programming](https://github.com/Sigma-eLabs/uc-programming) will focus on familiarizing with microcontroller programming activities like:
* Reading the techincal documents to gain knowledge about the hardware of microcontroller, which is very important and very helpful when working with microcontroller.
* Knowing how to interact (read/write) with the registers, which place the "connection gate" between software and hardware.
* Learn about the functionality of peripherals and how to use them to fullfil the requirements.

The topics may be simple, but I believe that it is a launchpad for you to approach the much higher complex technical topic in embedded programming world!

# Requisitions
## Hardware
Development Kit used in the most of topics is [Tiva C Series TM4C123G LaunchPad Evaluation Kit - EK-TM4C123GXL](https://www.ti.com/tool/EK-TM4C123GXL). The main microcontroller on the development kit is ARM Cortex-M4F 32-bit produced by Texas Instruments. Moreover, there is on-board Debugger/Programmer (Stellaris ICDI) that enable user quickly flashes and debugs easily.

Additionally, during testing và debugging, I also use Logic Analyzer to measure and capture the signal of microcontroller input/output pins.

## Software
[Keil C](https://www.keil.com/demo/eval/arm.htm) is an IDE developed by ARM company. It is a very powerful tool supports software engineer to compose, edit, compile, flash code and debug. Especially, with non-comercial version, I think it fully supports all your needs to study and research.

To visualize the measured signals of microcontroller pins from Logic Analyzer and easy to analyze the logs, [Logic 2](https://www.saleae.com/pages/downloads) tool is one of the suitale choice.
